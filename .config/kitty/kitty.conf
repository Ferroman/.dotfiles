#: Choose exactly which OpenType features to enable or disable. This
#: is useful as some fonts might have features worthwhile in a
#: terminal. For example, Fira Code Retina includes a discretionary
#: feature, zero, which in that font changes the appearance of the
#: zero (0), to make it more easily distinguishable from Ã˜. Fira Code
#: Retina also includes other discretionary features known as
#: Stylistic Sets which have the tags ss01 through ss20.
#: Note that this code is indexed by PostScript name, and not the font
#: family. This allows you to define very precise feature settings;
#: e.g. you can disable a feature in the italic font but not in the
#: regular font.
#: On Linux, these are read from the FontConfig database first and
#: then this, setting is applied, so they can be configured in a
#: single, central place.
#: To get the PostScript name for a font, use kitty + list-fonts
#: --psnames:
#: .. code-block:: sh
#:     $ kitty + list-fonts --psnames | grep Fira
#:     Fira Code
#:     Fira Code Bold (FiraCode-Bold)
#:     Fira Code Light (FiraCode-Light)
#:     Fira Code Medium (FiraCode-Medium)
#:     Fira Code Regular (FiraCode-Regular)
#:     Fira Code Retina (FiraCode-Retina)
#: The part in brackets is the PostScript name.
#: Enable alternate zero and oldstyle numerals::
#:     font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero +onum
#: Enable only alternate zero::
#:     font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero
#: Disable the normal ligatures, but keep the calt feature which (in
#: this font) breaks up monotony::
#:     font_features TT2020StyleB-Regular -liga +calt
#: In conjunction with force_ltr, you may want to disable Arabic
#: shaping entirely, and only look at their isolated forms if they
#: show up in a document. You can do this with e.g.::
#:     font_features UnifontMedium +isol -medi -fina -init
font_features Iosevka Term +ss04 +zero

# Choose how you want to handle multi-character ligatures. The
# default is to always render them.  You can tell kitty to not render
# them when the cursor is over them by using cursor to make editing
# easier, or have kitty never render them at all by using always, if
# you don't like them. The ligature strategy can be set per-window
# either using the kitty remote control facility or by defining
# shortcuts for it in kitty.conf, for example::
#     map alt+1 disable_ligatures_in active always
#     map alt+2 disable_ligatures_in all never
#     map alt+3 disable_ligatures_in tab cursor
# Note that this refers to programming ligatures, typically
# implemented using the calt OpenType feature. For disabling general
# ligatures, use the font_features setting.
